            <h4>Description:</h4>
            <p>The Veteran Service Tracking and Analytics Program, VS-TAP, is a 
                project that will add customer tracking and useful analytics to 
                the Veteran Services (VS) on campus. The main goal of the VS-TAP 
                project is to automate the data analytic functions that the center 
                requires.  These functions serve multiple purposes, such as judging 
                the success of events, judging the usefulness of the center, and 
                justifying the center's funding level.  In past years separate data 
                sources were manually consolidated and analyzed by Veteran Services 
                staff, and reports were created manually in Excel.  VS-TAP aims to 
                automate where possible to make creating useful tables and graphs 
                easy and allow the creation of more complex reports. Between 
                document consolidation and web hosting Veteran Services will only 
                be required to upload a single file as opposed to manually 
                compiling reports. This data is then all stored in a single 
                database, which allows for easy querying of the data, and dynamic 
                report generation.   </p>

                <p>Because this project stores and displays sensitive student data, 
                    user authentication is vital to comply with The Family 
                    Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).  The website will 
                    only be accessible from computers on the University network, and 
                    users will have to login to accounts created by an administrator 
                    at the VMC.  User login information is hashed and stored in a 
                    database.  The admin user has access to create and delete 
                    accounts, as well as reset other user passwords should they 
                    forget their password.  </p>
